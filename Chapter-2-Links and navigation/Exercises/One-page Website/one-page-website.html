    <p>The series centres on the love story of Shim Cheong (Jun Ji-hyun), a mermaid, and Heo Joon-jae (Lee Min-ho), a witty con-artist. Focusing on rebirth, fate, and unrequited love, their tale is juxtaposed with the parallel story of their Joseon-era incarnations, the mermaid, Se-hwa, and town head, Kim Dam-ryeong.</p>

  <section id="overview"><b>Overview</b></section>
  <p> Inspired by a classic Joseon legend from Korea's first collection of unofficial historical tales, about a fisherman who captured and kidnapped a mermaid, this drama tells the love story between the son of a Joseon noble family named Kim Dam Ryung (Lee Min Ho) and a mermaid he named Se Hwa (Jun Ji Hyun). Sometime during August, 1598, newly appointed governor Kim Dam Ryung stayed for a night at an inn run by Lord Yang (Sung Dong Il). During that evening, Lord Yang shows Dam Ryung a captured mermaid named Se Hwa. Later that night, Dam Ryung releases her into the ocean and, before she swims away, Se Hwa reaches out her hand to Dam Ryung which he briefly holds. In the present day, Heo Joon Jae is a smooth talking con man with magician-like abilities. He works with Jo Nam Doo and Tae Oh. For their next score, Joon Jae impersonates a prosecutor and swindles a large amount of money from a wealthy suspect's mother. Joon Jae then escapes to Spain and stays at an oceanside resort. Meanwhile, Shim Chung is a mermaid who gets caught in a tidal wave and is washed ashore near the oceanside resort. There she meets Joon Jae.</p>

    <i>Korean Drama Review by Jill, USA</i><br>
    <br>
    I so wanted to fall in love with this fantasy romance drama, The Legend Of The Blue Sea (2016-2017), which had flashback historical drama scenes thrown in to create a certain moody mystique for the audience, but after only a few episodes I quickly became bored. I'm not quite sure how I stayed the course with this show except through sheer will power. I expected this to be an A rated show --- and they tried --- but all it did was make me miss the far superior crowd pleasing worldwide hit K-drama My Love From Another Star (2013-2014) whenever I laid eyes on actress Gianna Jun, and it made me miss the far more passionately executed and directed Faith (2012) whenever I laid eyes on Lee Min Ho. Perhaps if I had seen Blue Sea BEFORE these other two shows I would have been more bowled over.<br>
    <br>
    For whatever reasons I just didn't see that much chemistry between the two leads. They seemed like they were acting with one another, whereas their chemistry with their former co-stars (for Gianna Jun that was darling Kim Soo Hyun and for Lee Min Ho it was delectable Hee Sun Kim) was completely natural and unforced. Although Gianna's character had moments of funny business in this show too all they really did was remind me of how utterly hilarious she had been in My Love From Another Star. (It didn't help that some of the same cast members were in Blue Sea, too, as constant reminders!). There was a no holds barred style of humor in Star; in Sea Gianna seemed far more reserved. How can great humor be reserved? When I want to laugh I want to ROAR with laughter, not titter. I want Monty Python humor, not Grandpa's old stale jokes around a dinner table.<br>
    <br>
    To be sure, the stars looked physically gorgeous, the cinematography was lovely, and the music was very pretty (every time Lyn sang the lyric "This Is Amazing!" in the lead song I got goosebumps!), but there just has to be more - there has to be an authentic affection between the two stars and I just didn't see it here, it always seemed forced to me (in press conferences before the show ran they even admitted they had trouble in that department, so it's not just my own perception on the matter).<br>
    <br>
    Also, one more complaint: there were too many extraneous characters in this drama who left me cold, like the two clingers-on who lived with the male lead character in the modern part of the story. I didn't see much reason for their existence except to plump up a story that didn't need plumping up. (They weren't nearly as cute as the two in Oh My Venus). Whenever the drama focused more on the main couple it improved, but  when it tried to distract the audience with side characters' personalities and issues it became boring. ("Where's the remote, honey?"). Since the writer of this drama was Park Ji Eun who happened to write My Love From Another Star too, it was doubly curious to me why it felt so flat. Maybe pressures were brought to bear on her to do things against her will. That's happened before to screenplay writers in K-dramaland history.<br>

    <i>Review by Kate Gardner</i><br>
    <br>
    Yes, yes, I think I am addicted. I wanted to give Lee Min-ho another chance after the awfulness that was The Heirs, because it was his acting (and maybe also his looks) that got me hooked on K-drama in the first place. Legend of the Blue Sea (SBS 2016/17) had been recommended to me as a K-drama with an awesome female lead, and also happens to star Lee Min-ho.<br>
    <br>
    This is a bit of a mix of genres. You could boil down the plot summary to: mermaid comes ashore for the first time, bumps into attractive man and much hilarity ensues. It’s a literal fish-out-water story. It’s Splash. But it’s also a historical drama (there are two timelines: one in Joseon era and one modern day), a crime drama, a family drama and of course a romance. And all of those genres appear in both comic and serious guises. Which could have been a hot mess, but it actually works pretty well.<br>
    <br>
    The series opens with a crime caper: Heo Joon-jae (Lee Min-ho) is part of a team of conmen ripping off a rich woman. Joon-jae uses hypnosis and suggestion as his contribution to the team, while Jo Nam-doo (Lee Hee-joon) leads the team and Tae Oh (Shin Won-ho) handles the computer wizardry. After the con they need to lay low for a while, so Joon-jae goes to Spain.<br>
    <br>
    Here we meet our mermaid Shi Cheong (Jun Ji-hyun) who comes ashore (her tail automatically turns into legs on shore) and is at first completely clueless – but she does have supernatural strength and the ability to erase memories. She takes a shine to Joon-jae and follows him around wordlessly until he caves and takes her under his wing.<br>
    <br>
    There’s a real charm to these early episodes. There’s lots of comedy, great acting and some stunning scenery (this section was filmed in Catalonia and Galicia). Some of this comedy and charm disappears when the action moves to Seoul and the plot gets complicated with family relationships, a serial murderer on the loose, lots of trust issues and some very earnest falling in love.<br>
    <br>
    I did like the folklore element. The show was apparently inspired by a historical tale about a mermaid contained in the short story anthology Eou Yadam by Joseon-era scholar Yu Mong-in. It gradually becomes clear that the Joseon-era scenes (featuring all the same actors as the modern-day) are telling a parallel tale and the key becomes whether both stories will have the same ending.<br>
    <br>
    I must admit I’m a sucker for that story of love so strong that it can’t help but repeat itself if the couple keep dying and being reborn. I know it’s not original, and neither is the evil stepmother or the estranged son hiding from his family, but that didn’t bother me.<br>
    <br>
    Guest star Jo Jung-suk (from Oh! My Ghost) has an adorable small role. I would have loved to see more scenes with him. I should definitely search out more of his work. There’s also a supporting role in the form of a young girl who helps Cheong when she first arrives in Seoul and I love that she remained a key part of Cheong’s friendship circle. Their relationship is very sweet.<br>
    <br>
    I did think that the show drags in the middle of its 20-episode run. I found myself wondering how there could possibly be another half a series still to come – but then it got exciting and plot-heavy again (in fact, the show could be accused of juggling too many subplots). I also found it suffered from that common problem of the stars being initially perky and sparky and then turning sad and earnest. And there were a few too many people giving precisely the wrong advice in a way that made them seem either sinister or stupid.<br>
    <br>
    The repeated K-pop songs (some of which must have been written for the show, as their lyrics seem to be specifically about its storyline) did get a bit irritating. That said, I think I went full circle and some of them grew on me to the extent that I’m tempted to buy one or two songs from the soundtrack.<br>
    <br>
    This is not a realistic TV show. But it has a magical sparkle, a romance that I actually found romantic, fabulous costumes and a satisfying ending.<br>
