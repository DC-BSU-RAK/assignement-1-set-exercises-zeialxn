          <li>1 tablespoon liquid ube extract (optional)</li>
          <li>1 block quick melt cheese (165g), cut into 12 cubes</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Note 1:</strong> The dough will be very sticky. To make it easier to handle, lightly oil your hands and the kneading surface to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li><strong>Note 2:</strong> Use the windowpane test to check if the dough is properly kneaded. Stretch a small piece—if it forms a thin, translucent membrane without tearing, it's ready. If it tears easily, knead a bit longer.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>In a small bowl, combine the ube powder and hot water. Stir until fully rehydrated.</li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
          <li>Add the warm milk, oil, and egg. Mix until combined, then add the yeast and mix again.</li>
          <li>Incorporate the rehydrated ube and ube extract (if using). Mix until well combined.</li>
          <li>The dough will be heavy and sticky—use oiled hands or a stand mixer if needed.</li>
          <li>Transfer the dough to a flat surface. Lightly oil your hands and knead for 7–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
          <li>Share the dough into a ball and lightly coat with oil. Return it to the bowl, cover, and let it rise until nearly doubled in size, about 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
          <li>Once risen, punch down the dough and divide it into two equal parts. Shape each part into a rectangle and divide into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.</li>
          <li>Flatten each ball and place a cube of cheese in the center. Fold the dough over the cheese to seal, then shape into a ball. Roll each ball in breadcrumbs.</li>
          <li>Arrange the filled dough balls on a baking sheet, leaving space between them. Let rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 340°F (170°C). Bake for 20 minutes or until lightly golden.</li>
          <li>Remove from oven and serve warm.</li>
